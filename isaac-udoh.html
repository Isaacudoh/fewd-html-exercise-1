        Of Patterns and Power: Web Standards Then and Now
    </h1>
	<p>
        In 
        <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/" target="_blank">"CONTENT Display Patterns"</a> 
        (which all front-end folk should read), Dan Mall point to a truth not unlike the one 
        <a href="https://24ways.org/2015/putting-my-patterns-through-their-paces/" target="_blank">Ethan Marcotte shared last month
        </a> on<i> 24 ways</i>. It is a truth as old as standards-based design: Contruct your markup to properly support your content (not your design).
		<br>
		<br>
	
        Molecular/<a href= "http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic design 
        <a/> doesn't change this truth, it just reinforces its wisdom. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"></a>Flexbox</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/"grid layout></a> don't change this truth, they just make it easier to do it better. <a href="https://html5forwebdesigners.com/design/index.html" target="_blank">HTML5</a> doesn't change this truth, it just reminds us that separation of structure from style came into existance for a reason. A reason that hasn't changed, because it is the core truth of the web, and is inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium.
        <br>
        <br>                        
    
        Separating structure from style and behavior was the web standards movement's prime revelation,and each generation of web designers discovers it anew. This separations is what makes our content as backward-compatible as it is foward-compatible or <a href="http://futurefriendlyweb.com/" target="_blank"> ("future-friendly,"</a>
        if you prefer).It's the key to re-use. The key to accessibility. The key to the new kinds of CMS systems we're just beginning to dream up. It's what makes our content as accessible to an ancient device as it will be to an unimagined future one.
        <br>
        <br>
    
        Every time a leader in our field discovers, as if for the first time, the genius of this separation between style, presentation and behavior, she is validating the brilliance of the web forbears like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie" target="_blank">Hakon Wium Lie</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos">Bert Bos.</a>
        <br>
        <br>
    
        Every time a Dan or an Ethan (or a <a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/">Sara</a> or a <a href="http://lea.verou.me/">Leah)<a/> writes a beautiful and insightful article like the two cited above, they are tellin new web designers and reminding experienced ones, that this separation of power matters.
        <br>
        <br>
    
        And they are plunging a stake into the increasingly slippery ground beneath us.
        <br>
        <br>
    
        Why is it slippery? Because too many developers and designers in our amnesiac community have begun to believe and share bad ideas - ideas, like CSS isn't needed, HTML isn't needed,<a href="https://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement" target="_blank"> progressive enhancement</a> is old fashioned and unneccessary, and so on. Ideas that, if followed, will turn the web back to what it was becoming in the late 1900s: a wasteland of walled gardens that said no to more than they welcomed. Let that never ne so.
        <br>
    
        We have the power.
        <br>
        <br>
    
        As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" target="_blank">Maimonides</a>, were he alive today, would tell us: he who exludes a singer user destroys a universe. Web standards now and forever.
